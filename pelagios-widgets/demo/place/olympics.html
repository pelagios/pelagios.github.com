<h1 class="oucontent-title-1">3 The broader context: Other athletic festivals in Ancient Greece</h1>
<p>Olympia was not the only place to host sporting games in Ancient Greece. The
 Greeks were passionate about athletic festivals, and different cultural 
 manifestations of the athletic spirit could be found in many regions of the

 In the 6<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE, as the influence and 
 cultural impact of the Olympics were consolidated, other major athletic 
 festivals began to emerge, each held at a different location under the patronage 
 of one of the Greek gods. Three of the more important festivals were the

 They were also referred to in Ancient Greece as the <i>Periodos</i> (i.e. circuit) Games, 
 because their starting dates were organised in a way that avoided clashing with each other, 
 thereby allowing athletes, as well as the more avid spectators, to attend a 
 different game every year if they wished to. The Nemean and

 They were sporting events held as part of the local Panathenaia religious celebrations, 
 which were organised in honour of the city’s patron goddess, Athena. The Panathenaic Games 
 were distinctive in that athletic victors were awarded emblematic large vessels 
 (known as Panathenaic amphorae) full of olive oil, which was a valuable commodity. 
 The Heraean Games also had a very distinctive aspect; only virgin females could compete.
