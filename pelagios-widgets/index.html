<h1>Pelagios Widgets</h1>
<p>The Pelagios widgets are widgets that you can embed on a web page to display
relationships between places and items in ancient history collections. The 
information displayed originates from museums, research institutes, 
universities and projects that are part of Pelagios, and includes details about 
these items and maps showing associated locations.</p>
<p> For more about Pelagios and a list of partners contributing data, see
<a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.uk/">the main Pelagios website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
There are currently two widgets: </p>

<h2>Pelagios Place Widget</h2>

<p>This takes the form of an icon, which when clicked, pops up information 
about a place. As well as data drawn from Pelagios partners,this including a 
map and images associated with the place. It can be used on web pages where a 
particular place is mentioned to allow users of the 
page to view the Pelagios information associated with th place. </p>
<p>Here is an 
example for Athens: <span id="456" data-pleiades_id="579885" class="pelagios pelagios-place"></span>
<p>
<h2>Pelagios Search Widget</h2>
<p>This allows you to search for a 
particular place. It displays all the matches in 
<a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">the Pleiades gazetteer</a> on a map and as 
a list. You can then view the Pelagios information associated with each of 
the places in these search results. </p>
