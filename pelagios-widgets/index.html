<h1>Pelagios Widgets</h1>
<p>The Pelagios widgets are widgets that you can embed on a web page to display 
data from the Pelagios partners. For  more about the Pelagios project, see
<a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.uk/">the main Pelagios website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
There are currently two widgets: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pelagios Place Widget</strong>: This displays Pelagios information associated with a specified place. It takes the form of an icon, which when clicked pops up the information about a place. It could be used for example on a web page where a particular place is mentioned to allow users of the page to view the Pelagios information associated with a place.
</li>
<li><strong>Pelagios Search Widget</strong>: This allows you to search for a particular place. It displays all the matches in the Pleiades gazetteer on a map and as a list. You can then view with the Pelagios information associated with each of the places in these search results.
<p>
</ul>
